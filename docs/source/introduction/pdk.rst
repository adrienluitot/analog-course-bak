Installing the PDK

Getting the PDK
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The first step is to download the PDK from the GitHub Repository. For this we go in our directory ``PDK/IHP/`` and we
clone the PDK:

.. code-block:: shell

  git clone https://github.com/IHP-GmbH/IHP-Open-PDK.git

This will download the files of the PDK in a folder ``IHP-Open-PDK``. You can leave it like that for the moment, we
will use it right after with the tools instructions.
